- [x] Provider onboarding service default price config input needs to be fixed. Only allowing 5 and 0 as inputs
- [ ] Fix all buttons throughput the app to have a spinner on them when loading... same as implemented in Admin part of dashboard
- [ ] When a page is reserved for ADMIN's only... or a user doesn't have authorization to see a page... don't send to page not found... have an appropriate message or send to login
- [ ] Provider requirements approval doesn't look great. Make it look better when the approve button is pressed
- [ ] Make sure all edits save and take you back to the display - its weird to still be in the edit form once the change is made
- [ ]
