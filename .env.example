# Upstash Redis (Rate Limiting - REQUIRED IN PRODUCTION)
# Free tier: 10,000 commands/day - Setup: https://console.upstash.com/redis
# CRITICAL: Without Redis, rate limiting fails in multi-instance production deployments
#
# STAGING ENVIRONMENT: Uses the same Redis database as production (cost-effective)
# - Configure these same credentials in Vercel Preview environment variables
# - Staging and production share the 10k commands/day limit (sufficient for both)
# - Rate limit keys are isolated by IP, so no collision between environments
