# MedBookings Workflow System

This directory contains the PRP-based workflow automation system for MedBookings development.

## Overview

The workflow system provides:
- **PRP-based task management** - Structured development process with Planning, Requirements, Prioritization
- **Automated validation** - 5 validation modes (pre, task, integration, issue, all)
- **Pattern extraction** - Learn from successful implementations and capture anti-patterns
- **Git workflow automation** - Automated checks and workflow orchestration
- **Database integrity checks** - Validate database health during development

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# For complete setup instructions with file templates, see:
# .claude/WORKFLOW.md - Section "📦 Complete Setup Instructions"

# After creating the required files (package.json.local, run-local.js,
# .workflow-enabled, .claude/settings.local.json), verify setup:
node run-local.js workflow:check

# Initialize workflow directories (if needed)
node run-local.js workflow:init
```

### 2. List Available Commands

```bash
# Show all workflow commands
node run-local.js --list
```

### 3. Run Your First Workflow Command

```bash
# Check git status
node run-local.js git:check

# Run pre-implementation validation
node run-local.js validate:pre

# List all code patterns
node run-local.js patterns:list
```

- `patterns:list` - List all available patterns
- `antipatterns:from-issue` - Capture anti-patterns from fixed issues

## Workflow Concepts

### PRP (Planning, Requirements, Prioritization)

The workflow system uses a PRP-based approach where each feature or issue goes through:

1. **Planning** - Technical analysis and design
2. **Requirements** - Specific tasks and acceptance criteria
3. **Prioritization** - Task ordering and dependencies

PRPs are stored in:
- `workflow/prps/features/` - For new features
- `workflow/prps/issues/` - For bug fixes and issues

### Validation Modes

The system supports 5 validation modes:

1. **Pre** (`validate:pre`) - Before starting implementation
   - Git status clean
   - Build passing
   - No linting errors

2. **Task** (`validate:task`) - After completing each task
   - Build still passes
   - No new linting errors
   - Tests passing (if applicable)

3. **Integration** (`validate:integration`) - After all tasks complete
   - Integration tests pass
   - No breaking changes
   - API contracts maintained

4. **Issue** (`validate:issue`) - After fixing an issue
   - Issue actually fixed
   - No regression introduced
   - Anti-pattern captured (if applicable)

5. **All** (`validate:all`) - Comprehensive validation
   - Runs all validation modes
   - Final check before PR

### Pattern System

The workflow system learns from your code:

- **Auto-detection** - Scans recent commits for successful patterns
- **Extraction** - Manually extract patterns from exemplary code
- **Review** - Staged patterns reviewed before approval
- **Approval** - Approved patterns moved to archive for future reference
- **Anti-patterns** - Capture patterns to avoid from fixed issues

## Configuration

### workflow/config.json

Main configuration file (committed to git). Contains:
- Directory paths
- Validation settings
- Pattern extraction rules
- PRP templates

### package.json.local

Personal workflow scripts (gitignored). Contains:
- npm scripts for workflow commands
- Personal script configurations
- Custom workflow aliases

### .claude/settings.local.json

## Customization

### Adding New Workflow Commands

1. Create a new script in `workflow/scripts/`
2. Add corresponding npm script to `package.json.local`
3. Test with `node run-local.js <command-name>`

### Modifying Validation Rules

1. Edit `workflow/scripts/validation/validate.js`
2. Update validation modes as needed
3. Test with `node run-local.js validate:all`

### Adding Code Patterns

1. Manually: `node run-local.js patterns:extract`
2. Auto: `node run-local.js patterns:auto`
3. Review: `node run-local.js patterns:review`
4. Approve: `node run-local.js patterns:approve`

## Troubleshooting

### "Workflow not initialized" error

```bash
node run-local.js workflow:init
```

### "Script not found" error

Ensure you've copied `package.json.local.example`:
```bash
cp package.json.local.example package.json.local
```

### "Permission denied" errors

Check `.claude/settings.local.json` permissions:
```bash
cp .claude/settings.local.json.example .claude/settings.local.json
```

### Build or lint errors during validation

Fix errors first, then re-run validation:
```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
node run-local.js validate:pre
```

## Integration with Claude Code

This workflow system is designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code:

1. **Workflow Commands** - Available in `.claude/commands/`
2. **Workflow Documentation** - See `.claude/WORKFLOW.md`
3. **Permissions** - Configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`

## Documentation

- **Workflow Guide**: `.claude/WORKFLOW.md`
- **Command Reference**: `.claude/commands/README.md`
- **Code Patterns**: `workflow/reference/code-patterns/`
- **PRP Templates**: `workflow/reference/prp/`
- **Runbooks**: `workflow/reference/runbooks/`

## Support

For questions or issues with the workflow system:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review `.claude/WORKFLOW.md` for detailed guidance
3. Examine existing PRPs in `workflow/reference/prp/` for examples

## Notes

- **Gitignored Files**: `package.json.local`, `.workflow-enabled`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, and all `workflow/prps/`, `workflow/patterns/staging/`, `workflow/technical-plans/` contents are personal and not committed
- **Shared Files**: Scripts, templates, and configuration are committed and shared with the team
- **Personal Preference**: The workflow system is optional - use what works for you!
