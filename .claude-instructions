# Claude Code Instructions

ALWAYS:
- Read and analyze ENTIRE files before making ANY edits
- Run syntax validation after each modification
- Use `grep -n` or `rg` to find all instances of modified functions/variables
- Execute `npx tsc --noEmit` after TypeScript changes
- Review adjacent files that import modified modules
- Provide context of 5 lines above/below when showing code changes

NEVER:
- Make partial edits without checking FULL file and function scope
- Assume variable names without verifying declarations
- Modify interfaces without checking all implementations
