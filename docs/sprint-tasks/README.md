# Sprint Tasks

This directory contains detailed technical task breakdowns for sprint planning and implementation.

## Purpose

Sprint tasks are comprehensive implementation guides that:
- Break down large technical work into manageable phases
- Provide step-by-step implementation instructions
- Include testing strategies and verification steps
- Define clear success criteria and definition of done
- Document risks, dependencies, and rollback procedures

## Task Status

| Task | Status | Priority | Est. Days | Created |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Resolve ESLint Type Safety Warnings](./resolve-eslint-type-safety-warnings.md) | 📋 Planned | Medium | 2-3 | 2025-10-09 |

## Status Legend

- 📋 **Planned** - Task defined, not started
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ✅ **Complete** - All phases finished and merged
- ⏸️ **Paused** - Work started but temporarily paused
- ❌ **Cancelled** - Task no longer needed

## Task Structure

Each sprint task document includes:

### 1. Overview
- Current state and goal
- Success criteria
- Story points and time estimates

### 2. Analysis
- Warning/issue breakdown by root cause
- Risk assessment
- Priority classification

### 3. Implementation Plan
- Phased approach (typically 3 phases)
- Detailed task breakdowns with time estimates
- Code examples and patterns to follow
- Files to create/update
- Verification commands

### 4. Testing Strategy
- Automated testing (build, lint, type check)
- Manual testing procedures
- Verification steps

### 5. Progress Tracking
- Warning/issue count targets
- Git commit strategy
- Progress verification commands

### 6. Documentation
- Files to update
- Examples to add
- Inline comments needed

### 7. Definition of Done
- Phase completion criteria
- Overall task completion criteria

## Using Sprint Tasks

### For Sprint Planning
1. Review task overview and story points
2. Check dependencies and risks
3. Assign to sprint based on priority and capacity
4. Break into subtasks in project management tool

### During Implementation
1. Follow phases in order
2. Use provided code examples and patterns
3. Run verification commands after each task
4. Commit after each completed task
5. Update task status in this README

### After Completion
1. Update task status to ✅ Complete
2. Document lessons learned
3. Archive or keep for reference

## Creating New Sprint Tasks

Use this template structure:
1. Overview (Current state, goal, success criteria)
2. Analysis (Breakdown, root causes, risks)
3. Implementation Plan (Phased approach with tasks)
4. Testing Strategy
5. Progress Tracking
6. Documentation Updates
7. Definition of Done

See existing tasks for examples.
